\begin_layout Standard
The aquifer module (AQU) is used to define the layout and properties of
 the ModAEM aquifer.
 In ModAEM, an aquifer is considered to be a single, horizontal, two-dimensional
 flow system.
 A ModAEM aquifer may be bounded or unbounded spatially, with a variety
 of boundary conditions specified at the perimeter of the bounded domain.
 All aquifers in ModAEM may have heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity, base
 elevation, thickness and porosity, specified in "inhomogeneities".
 An inhomogeneity is a bounded sub-region of the aquifer where the hydraulic
 properties of the aquifer differ from the surrounding region.
 In ModAEM, inhomogeneities may be nested within other inhomogeneities,
 and may share common boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Aquifers in ModAEM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most analytic element models, ModAEM supports heterogeneous aquifers
 in which aquifer properties are constant within polygonal domains (aquifer
 properties are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

piecewise--constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 In ModAEM, each subdomain may have its own aquifer base and top elevation,
 hydraulic conductivity, and porosity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
AQU Module Input 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with all other modules that are included in the problem definition section
 of a ModAEM script file, input for module AQU is contained between the
 
\family sans
aqu
\family default
 directive and the 
\family sans
end
\family default
 directive.
 Module AQU differs from some of the other ModAEM modules, in that it posesses
 optional submodules.
 The general layout for module AQU input is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:reference-flow-field"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ModAEM differs from some analytic element codes in that the specification
 of a reference point is often unnecessary.
 Typically, the reference flow field is only needed in conceptual models
 or when a site--scale model based on a uniform flow field has been measured
 in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
What is the reference flow field? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an analytic element model, it is possible to define a problem in which
 all of the elements (wells, etc.) possess a specified discharge (e.g.
 the common conceptual model of one or more wells in a uniform flow field).
 In these cases, a unique solution can be generated only if the user specifies
 a point in the aquifer at which the head is known.
 Specification of the reference point enables the specification of a "reference
 flow field", a uniform flow discharge that will be present everywhere in
 the aquifer, even if no elements are present.
 The reference flow field is an abstraction, and should be used with care,
 since it typically dominates the solution and increases the potential of
 calibration errors.
 In ModAEM, specification of the reference point is optional.
 If the reference point it is omitted, ModAEM replaces it with a closure
 condition based upon continuity of flow.
 In ModAEM, there are three ways to provide the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 regional flow conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_inset

flow In this case, the 
\family sans
ref
\family default
 directive is provided.
 A reference point and a reference head, and also a far--field uniform flow
 discharge is provided.
 This strategy is typically used in conceptual problems and in simple site--scal
e problems where the hydraulic gradient has been measured from field observation
s.
 Do not place the reference point within the area of interest if other elements,
 e.g.
 line sinks, are to be used.

far--field This is the most common strategy for large regional models to
 be built with analytic elements.
 Instead of a specific far--field flow condition, far--field elements are
 placed in the model domain.
 These elements generate the flow field at the perimeter of the study region,
 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

insulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the study region from the infinite mathematical domain.
 In ModAEM, no reference point is required if at least one head--specified
 boundary condition is provided in the model.
 A continuity--of--flow condition is used instead
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In ModAEM-1.0 and ModAEM-1.2, the reference point was always required.
 In WhAEM, the GUI placed the reference point at a location far to the west
 of the extent or model elements, with a reference head set at the average
 of all head--specified conditions in the model.
 ModAEM-1.4 eliminates this requirement.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If a reference point is specified far from the study region, the model
 will still function if the model is constructed properly (see Haitjema,
 1995).
 Never place the reference point at a location within the study domain;
 unpredictable and incorrect model output may result.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ModAEM supports the option of bounded aquifer domains, with a variety of
 boundary conditions specified at the perimeter of the flow domain (head
 specified, flux specified, and general--head).
 Bounded aquifers are defined in the ModAEM script file in two steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specifying the perimeter of the aquifer and any "islands" (sub-regions within
 the aquifer that are to be ignored) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specifying the boundary conditions for groundwater flow that are to be construct
ed at the perimeter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that step (1) above actually has no affect
 on the flow problem; it simply tells ModAEM which regions of the potentially
 unbounded aquifer are to be ignored by the anaysis modules.
 This is convenient when computing grids for contouring.
 ModAEM returns an "inactive region" value whenever an analysis module requests
 the head (or discharge or other value) at a point in the inactive region.
 It is step (2) above that actually constructs the boundary conditions at
 the aquifer perimeter.
 Specification of the boundary conditions is sufficient to govern the flow
 problem

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
bdy
\family default
 directive begins the definition of flow conditions at the perimeter of
 a bounded aquifer.
 For each segment of the boundary, a pair of vertices is provided, along
 with the boundary condition to be met along the segment.
 In the current release of ModAEM, this is the only instance where line
 segments are fully defined in this manner.
 When this was originally implemented in ModAEM-1.2, it was intended for
 the construction of ModAEM sub--domain models from large regional MODFLOW
 models (ref: Vic's talk at GSA -- Denver).
 This input style is more flexible for preprocessing in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 domain models.
 The boundary segments must uniquely bound a closed region; ModAEM will
 automatically build the bounding polygon for the 
\family sans

 elements.
 A fatal error will be issued if the boundary elements do not bound a unique,
 conticuous polygonal region.
 If the model requires that inactive regions be included within a model
 (in either a bounded or unbounded aquifer), see the

\begin_layout Standard
In the case where base elevation and aquifer thickness are constant throughout
 the model domain, or when the flow is confined everywhere in the model,
 the equations solved by ModAEM for inhomogeneities are linear; only a few
 iterations are needed to achieve an accurate solution.
 In the case where the base elevation or aquifer thickness varies 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 there are regions within the model where the flow is unconfined, the solution
 matrix contains coefficients that are dependent on the saturated thickness;
 additional iterations are required to achieve an accurate solution.
 For this reason, each subdomain in the model has an additional parameter,
 the '
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

initial average head
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The initial average head is the modeler's best estimate for the average
 head in the subdomain.
 It is used to compute the saturated thickness during the first model iteration.
 Obviously, a good estimate for the initial average head helps the model
 stability.

\begin_layout Subsection
Specifying inhomogeneities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, ModAEM allows for both closed polygonal inhomogeneities
 that do not share edges and for complex polygonal inhomogeneities that
 may have shared edges.
 ModAEM requires that the specification of inhomogeneities be done in two
 steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Defining the polygonal regions using the 
\family sans
dom
\family default
 directive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Where necessary, defining the strings of elements that implement the boundaries
 using the 
\family sans
str
\family default
 directive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Task (2) can be very complicated.
 Fortunately there are preprocessing tools such as GMS (EMS-I) and ArcInfo
 that provide an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

arc--node
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data representation to make it simpler.
 For many problems, inhomogeneities with common boundaries are unnecessary.
 Fortunately, ModAEM makes it easier to specify these (see below).

 This is an estimate of the average head in the aquifer.
 It is used to pre--condition the solution when inhomogeneities in base
 elevation or thickness are encountered and the flow condition is unconfined.
 If you expect to be using inhomogeneities in base elevation or aquifer
 thickness, a good estimate of the initial average head will greatly speed
 the solution process.
 If you are not using inhomogeneities in base elevation or aquifer thickness,
 it is recommended that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $base+thickness$

 be provided.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[L]$
