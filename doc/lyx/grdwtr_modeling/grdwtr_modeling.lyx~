\begin_layout Standard
How do I build an analytic element model with ModAEM? How does ModAEM work?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using ModAEM is much like using any other analytic element code.
 Somehow, the modeler constructs a script file that controls the creation
 of the model, first defining the aquifer properties and their distribution,
 then adds elements to the aquifer that simulate various features in the
 flow system, such as rivers and wells.
 The script file also directs the solution of the model problem and uses
 various analytical tools to extract results as grids, trace streamlines,
 and write reports.

\begin_layout Standard
This section introduces some important principles of analytic element models,
 with the purpose of introducing the new ModAEM user to analytic elements.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What is an analytic element?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analytic element method is based on the superposition of analytic functions.
 An

 is a mathematical function that may be superimposed with other analytic
 elements to create a complete solution for a groundwater problem.
 In practice, two--dimensional, steady--state analytic elements come in
 two varieties,
